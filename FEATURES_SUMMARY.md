## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Phase 0: Strategic Foundation Setup

**Location**: `src/app/sim/setup/page.tsx`

A 6-step onboarding that defines the entire simulation:

#### Step 1: Company Naming
- Custom text input with live preview
- Name appears throughout simulation
- Creates personal connection to campaign

#### Step 2: Time Horizon Selection
- **1-Year Sprint**: $500K budget, aggressive tactics, high risk
- **3-Year Growth**: $1M budget, balanced approach, moderate risk  
- **5-Year Long Game**: $2M budget, brand building, lower risk
- Each horizon affects available tactics and scoring

#### Step 3: Industry Selection
- **Healthcare**: $5K customer value, long sales cycle, high competition
- **Legal Services**: $8K customer value, very long cycle, medium competition
- **E-commerce**: $150 customer value, short cycle, very high competition
- Industry determines A/B tests, wildcards, and market dynamics

#### Step 4: Company Profile
- **Startup**: 5-20 people, lean budget, agile, innovative
- **Enterprise**: 100+ people, large budget, resources, slower decisions
- Affects team capacity, starting brand equity, and available tactics

#### Step 5: Market Landscape
- **The Disruptor**: vs. 1 large incumbent (5x your budget)
- **The Crowded Field**: vs. many startups (3x total budget)
- **The Open Frontier**: New market (1.2x budget), low awareness
- Determines competitor behavior and market saturation

#### Step 6: Budget Allocation
- Distribute 100% across three buckets:
  - **Brand Awareness** (Top of Funnel): Content, SEO, Social
  - **Lead Generation** (Mid-Funnel): Ads, Webinars
  - **Conversion Optimization** (Bottom of Funnel): A/B Testing, CRO
- Allocation constrains tactical choices throughout simulation

**Technical Implementation**:
- Multi-step form with progress tracking
- Framer Motion animations between steps
- Validation at each step
- Data persisted to localStorage
- Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

### 2. Advanced Scoring Engine

**Location**: `src/lib/scoringEngine.ts`

Realistic marketing math with multiple interconnected systems:

#### Hidden Metrics (Not Directly Visible)

**Brand Equity (0-100)**:
- Starts at 60 (enterprise) or 40 (startup)
- Increases with: Quality content, PR, customer satisfaction
- Decreases with: Neglect (5% decay/quarter), controversies
- Effect: Provides conversion rate multiplier (0.5x to 1.5x)
- Formula: `newEquity = currentEquity - decay + contentBoost + prBoost + satisfactionBoost - controversyPenalty`

**Team Morale (0-100)**:
- Starts at 75
- Decreases with: Overwork (>90% capacity), crises, failures
- Increases with: Training, successes, good decisions
- Effect: Affects ALL campaign outputs (0.3x to 1.0x multiplier)
- Formula: `newMorale = currentMorale - burnoutPenalty + trainingBoost + successBoost - crisisPenalty`

#### Core Calculations

**Market Share (Share of Voice Model)**:
```typescript
shareOfVoice = yourSpend / (yourSpend + competitorSpend)
brandMultiplier = 1 + (brandEquity / 200)
targetShare = shareOfVoice * brandMultiplier * 100
newShare = (previousShare * 0.3) + (targetShare * 0.7) // 30% inertia
```

**SEO/Content (Compounding Growth)**:
```typescript
// Each quarter's investment grows at 15% per quarter
baseTraffic = investment * 0.5 // $1 = 0.5 visitors initially
compoundedTraffic = baseTraffic * Math.pow(1.15, quartersActive)
```

**Paid Ads (Diminishing Returns)**:
```typescript
// Effectiveness drops as spend increases
saturationPenalty = 1 - (marketSaturation * 0.4)
spendEfficiency = Math.log10(spend + 1) / Math.log10(spend + 10000)
effectiveSpend = spend * saturationPenalty * spendEfficiency
```

**Final Strategy Score**:
```typescript
strategyScore = (finalMarketShare * 1000) + (roi * 100) + (brandEquity * 10)
```

This formula rewards:
- Market share growth (most valuable)
- ROI/efficiency (important)
- Brand building (long-term value)

**Grading Scale**:
- A+: 8000+ points
- A: 6000-7999 points
- B: 4000-5999 points
- C: 2000-3999 points
- D: 1000-1999 points
- F: <1000 points
